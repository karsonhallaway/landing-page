# Landing Page

This project showcases my basic html and css skills to build a landing page for my portfolio.  

- I used flex box to space the contents of each section. 
- navbar ul li a tag structure to make the navbar. with brand color styling show the viewer the nav links are clickable using hover states. 

Overall, I'm pleased with how it turned out and I can't wait learn about media Queries.
